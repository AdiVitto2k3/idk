    <p>
        The panzer I, used in the invasion of poland is more of a tankette than an actual tank, effective against
        infantry.

        <img src="Pz. II.png" alt="PzII">
        <figcaption>Panzerkampfwagen II</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The panzer II, one of the best early war tanks used until 1942 had a 20mm autocannon and a mg34 as it's weapons,
        it was small, reliable, effective, and easy to use.
    </p>

        <img src="13th Panzer Division.png" alt="PzIII">
        <figcaption>Panzerkampfwagen III</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The panzer III, used in the invasion of poland, france and in sicily and in El Alamein, the panzer III is a
        pretty reliable and good tank armed with a 37mm cannon.
        The one shown is from the 13th Panzer Division
    </p>

    </p>
    <figure>
        <img src="Pz. IV F2.png" alt="PzIV">
        <figcaption>Panzerkampfwagen IV Ausf. F2</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The panzer IV is one of the best early war tanks, the F2 variant had a long 75mm cannon made for anti-tank use,
        the tank
        served from 1939 to 1945.
    </p>

        <figcaption>Panzerkampfwagen V "Panther"</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The panzerkampfwagen panther is one of the best tanks of WW2, using sloped armor/glacis plates for protection,
        some regard it as the best tank of the war, about ~20 models had a special night vision camera on top of the
        tank accesable for the commander via hatch, the rest of the crew could not use it and the commander could only
        see it from outside.

    </figure>
    <p>
        The Panzer VI "Tiger" first introduced in 1942 in the african campaign, is one of the most well known tanks in
        the world, the tiger was a powerful tank with a 88 mm cannon which was first used in Anti Air purposes, then
        anti-tank and then a special versino was made for tank-use, the tiger did NOT have glacis plates, but it still
        posed a threat and was a big demoralizer in 1944-1945 for the Allied forces, fearing it even tho only 800 were
        made and they weren't even that common on the Western front. Porsche and Henschel were the main competetors for
        the Panzer 6, the Porsche variant had a better transmission, less armor, and the turret in the front. Lost to
        the Henschel variant.

    </figure>
    <p>
        The Panzer VI II, commonly called the king tiger, Tiger II or konigstiger, was most probably made to drain
        Germany of all of it's resources, breaking down for no reason and removing the last fuel supplies in very late
        1944 till the end of the war, the tiger II had a 666 kill count.

        <figcaption>Panzerkampfwagen VIII "Maus"</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
        The panzer VIII, commonly called the Maus was a series of 2 german super heavy prototypes, weighting 188 tons,
        which was a project from Porsche and Krupp, the leading german tank engineers the 2 prototypes were attempted to
        be destroyed, the 1st prototype's hull was destroyed and the 2nd prototype's turret was destroyed, leading a
        combination of a 1st prototype turret and a 2nd prototype's hull. (In a Russian museum currently)
